*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

The websites that I've visited show to be more feature rich in what they allow the user to accomplish. They showcase subcategories that are based in various regions, along with the type of activities one intend to plan around.

*List at least 10 product features*

1. Airbnb has a feature that checks for both check in and check out dates, as well as an additional filter determining the age demographics looking for a place.
2. Airbnb lists categories based on the type of vacation one may consider such as being in the arctic, golfing, residing in a beachside, etc.
3. On mobile, bluepillow and airbnb have their containers placed as one giant column when showcasing recommendations.
4. the map within vrbo showcases pinpoints locatring approximate locations of the available rentals.
5. When clicking on a recommendation by bluepillow, the user is given an option of a hotel or an alternative (farmstay for niagara falls visit).
6. All sites provide an overview for the selected rental on amenenties and policies the user must abide by.
7. All sites link to a page if one wishes to use their property as a rental.
8. Airbnb provides "online experiences" where users can pay for sessions with famous people or routine guides on daily activites (organization, team building, etc.)
9. All sites provide a list of possible locations from user input in the search bar.
10. Bluepillow compares its listings and prices with booking.com



## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that a majority of users who visit these sites are unsure of their exact destination they wish to visit, but instead have a basic idea of the activities or scenery that will drive their decision making. As well as being overwhelemed by the amount of options thrown at the beginning of the regions page.
